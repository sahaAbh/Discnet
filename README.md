# R implementation of variable selection, and estimation methodology,Discnet, for discrete survival time with frailty

Please visit the [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03762) to have full access to the manuscript, and to know more details on the notations, and contexts the attached code refers to. We have demontrataed how to reproduce a simulation  scenario using the main R function, *Discnet.R*, and the auxilary subroutines in the R code, *Demo.R*. All the auxilary R-programs required for this demo are given in *Preload.R* while the ones related to Discnet are provided in the library folder ElasticLib, both of which need to be kept in the same folder as that of Discnet.R and demo.R. 

Please refer to **R_DEMO_README.pdf** for a step-by-step implementation of a simulation scenario as considered in the main manuscript.
